<p>At this late hour, the Penrose Triangle team is hard at work on a number of infrastructure needs.  <a href="http://penrosetriangle.com/wordpress/?p=357" target="_blank">Previously</a>, the work on the base was in full swing. With most of the main components of the base worked out, the base arm of the triangle sits bolted into place. The two side arms are resting on the side, waiting to get fit with lighting track and wiring.</p>

<br>
<p>Each section needs special attention with respect to the kind of wiring that needs to take place. With the bottom/base arm and one of the cubes in place, the team makes sure that the transition between the track on the cube and the arm are smooth.</p>

<p>Here you get a good look at the base and see how exactly the triangle will stay vertical and stable. The sculpture could stand on it's own  given it's geometry and foot print, but the playa conditions, wind and climbing participants require a far more stable footing. The white line you see scribbled on the steel base in the photo below is the level at which the playa will be. The rest will be buried underground for added stability. Note also that the beams on the floor only follow the form of the base but do not include all the cross beams as indicated on the <a href="../uploads/2013/08/Foot-layout-1024x596.png" target="_blank">foot layout plan</a>. That is part of the work going on right now. Much grinding, much welding...</p>

<br>
<p>You'll also notice (apart from that beautiful white powder coat!!) the aluminum track in the side. All of the <a href="../uploads/2013/07/04.P1010403_edit_1200x.jpg" target="_blank">lighting strips</a> will rest in this track. IT COVERS EVERY SURFACE! Seriously there is a lot of lighting on this thing and as such, the track is set on most surfaces at specific angles to maximize the lighting effects.  Those strips of white material in the background is just some of the heat shrink that will be needed to reseal every LED strip once it's been cut to the appropriate size. There are a lot of ends to tie up.</p>

<p>Here is the site of one of the junction boxes that will live in the corner of each of the three cubes.  There are so many details on this sculpture that will go unnoticed because of the way it's designed.  This spider web of cable will be hidden within seamlessly constructed junction boxes. Delivering programming and power to every light is going to take a lot of wire:</p>

<p>Steel tubing does not come with neat little holes for wires. Every place where a plate hits the pipe has to be drilled out to allow the wiring to go through. Here are we see a section of plate welded and powder coated, the hole is then drilled and deburred. Finally, wiring is fed through:</p>

<p>Here's a strip of lighting attached to one of the custom circuit boards detailed in my <a href="http://penrosetriangle.com/wordpress/?p=340" target="_blank">Light Hardware</a> post.  Right now there is extensive testing on the wiring and power strategy on the structure. After every member section is wired up, it has to be tested before replicating on all other analogous parts. This is one of the strips getting ready to be hooked up.</p>

<p>A closer look at one of those custom <a href="../uploads/2013/07/02.P1010398_edit_1200x.jpg" target="_blank">circuit boards</a> in action.  That is a lot of soldering for what amounts to one the end of one lighting strip among so many.</p>

<p>As the wiring and testing continues, problems arise. Strips don't work as expected, don't work to satisfaction or just don't work period. Everything has to be tested and corrected before it can be implemented throughout. One cube receives a massive amount of attention and testing before the team can move on. A cube sits in the back, waiting for the Ok while Dewb works out the kinks with Drew's helpful advice:</p>

<p>Meanwhile,  Surly addresses the power situation. All those lights are not going to light themselves. Making do what is available. If it doesn't work, figure it out, make it work:</p>

<p>As I was walking out the door, I was working out some details of our camping situation with Blake Courtney (OH YEAH, EVERYONE HAS TO FIGURE OUT HOW THEY ARE GOING TO LIVE OUT THERE) . I have the luxury of getting to step back and work out my personal situation while the rest of the team continues to work on this. While chatting with Blake, testing continues  in the background. Suddenly one of the strips that is half draped along the top of a corner of the cube fully lights up. Blake gets a big smile on his face and exclaims "There's lights on it!" I started laughing loudly. I thought I was laughing <em>with</em> him, but he wasn't joking.  He says "No seriously, after all this time, I can finally see some light on that thing. I don't care that it's just sitting there."  That sort of snapped me back to the reality of this project. It's been a long time and taken a lot of effort to go from a small plastic sculpture to an idea to a large, hand made steel sculpture. Every new milestone is an achievement. Lately, the pace has picked up as the base is built out, the structure is powder coated, lighting is independently tested and finally mounted to the sculpture. It's good to see it happen step by step and I am very excited to see the vision realized in such grand detail.  I get the sense that this will be my favorite art project on the playa. I hope and I am sorta banking on the idea that I won't be the only one to feel that way.  A lot of people at home and abroad have contributed with advice, kickstarter donations and nose-to-the-grind-stone labor. I can't help but think, personally, that this thing will not let them down.</p>

<p>Like every other night as of late, the work continues. There is a lot going on at this moment and the work continues as more people from the community and assorted friends and family show up to help. Tonight's going to be a(nother) long night...</p>
