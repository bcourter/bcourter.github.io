<p>The containers need to load in nine days, and we are sprinting.  No major impediments, but there's a lot of execution left.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>One critical part of the design is the base.  We didn't want to have dangerous guy wires interfering with the piece, so we designed a heavy-ass base for it.  Actually, "we" designed a reasonably lightweight base, but Surly just fell in love with those chunks of '93.  Once he had them where he wanted them, he turned the over to Shop Monkey for cleanup.</p>

<p>It's coming together pretty will.  The vertices are made out of an old gas tank, a larger version of the kind used to make the bells you ring when you enter the event.  There should be some good hippie BS there.  "The bell I ran as a virgin has been symbolically cut into pieces and made the foundation of this work."</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>The tank's wall is only about 5/16, and the flanges are 3/8 and 1/2", which makes them considerably beefier.  We'll reinfoce the tops to stiffen them up, but I also like that they will bend first, letting the base move and settle  We'll still have 3800 lbf anchors on each part of the long extensions.</p>

<p>That lower arm is looking pretty good all powder coated, isn't it?</p>
