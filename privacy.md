This website is hosted by Github and includes services from Github and Google, including commenting systems and analytics.  Any information you submit could be used in any way, but the operators of this site (actually just Blake Courter) will not sell the information to anyone.  If you give me your contact info, I might contact you in the future for any reason whatsoever, becuase gen X folks like me grew up with phones and are like that.  I might even name drop that you downloaded something from my website at a conference or something.  That said, I intend to comply with the GDPR, which seems like a pretty good law in general.
