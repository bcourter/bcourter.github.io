When working with fields, it's helpful to keep track of with what one is working.  I use the following annotations to stay sane:

| Plane                 | $$\plane{P}$$ |
| Distance field        | $$\df{D}$$ |
| Unit gradient field   | $$\ugf{U}$$ |
| Unit gradient at zero | $$\augf{A}$$ |

The two body field of two distance fields:

$$ \frac{\df{A}-\df{B}}{\df{A}+\df{B}} $$
