Over on the [LatticeRobot](https://www.latticerobot.com) blog, a long post about our approach to LatticeRobot's parameterization.  

## [The LatticeRobot Unit Cell Parameter System](https://news.latticerobot.com/the-latticerobot-unit-cell-system/)

In addition, it's worth mentioning that these parameterizations are build on top of [Gradient Control Laboratories](https://www.gradientcontrol.com)' high level implicit scripting language, GCL Script ("GCLS"), provides a novel, high level API to implicits and powers LatticeRobot's CodeRep output.  Please be in touch if you'd like to learn more.
