*[Here's just the map!](/landscape/)*

There was a time when I could keep track of all the engineering software companies.  We had a few big CAD and CAE vendors, a handful of smaller companies defying VC pressure, and a CAM company for every manufacturing market.  3D printers were things that our resellers lugged around but didn't really work. Life was simple.  I could keep it all in my head.

About a decade ago, 3D printing brought a ton of post-2008 capital.  STEM experiments evolved into our workforce, and engineering became surprisingly popular.  For the first time, consumer trends and mainstream software companies began to emulate our tech, and we all had to deal with triangle meshes.  We made some of the 3D printers work, but the ethos of engineering evolved into a sci-fi future where autonomously generated designs are fabricated in Westworld slurries via robots murmuring in unlit, underground facilities.  We all know what happened to Westworld.

*Westworld's trunnion of the future*

While we gazed at our topology and field-optimized lattice parts, still sticky in our hands, and exclaimed that our "generative" and "computational" future had arrived, another industry was lurking.  The same people who rendered our pretty pictures somehow started doing actual engineering on blockchain mining hardware.  The next thing we knew, ML tech and AI solutions replaced out notion of "generative" with something more diffusive.  And how did they do it?  With the tricks of our trade: curve fitting, now rebranded as "surrogate modeling", with MDO on steroids to interpolate massive parameter sweeps of the data.  

It appears that when you take the [nvidia Modulus training course](https://developer.nvidia.com/modulus), they now bundle in a Delaware C corp kit in partnership with [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/).  There are a few dozen startups using physics-powered neural nets on fluid dynamics problems, forever freeing CFD from the concept of Reynolds number until you want to validate your results with "empirical" data from [OpenFoam](https://www.openfoam.com/).  Will 1000x faster solve times grow the market for CFD and perhaps CAE in general?

Dare we try to ask our incumbent friends, we may have difficult finding them.  A decade or so of consolidation is even getting the [attention](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4055182-cadence-siemens-also-bid-for-ansys-cnbc) of EDA.  The map seems less simple.

## It started with the startups

In the fall of '23, [Alex Huckstepp](https://medium.com/@alexhuckstepp) reached out to me with half dozen or so AI and ML engineering software companies he was talking to and asked me for a take.  I didn't know much about them, but had a similar list of friends, so I added it to his spreadsheet.  Then I met up with [Andy Fine](https://finephysics.com/), who was digging into the CFD side of things.  Brad Rotherberg from [nTop](https://www.ntop.com) was working on his own list, and Luke Church, my partner at [Gradient Control Laboratories](https://www.gradientcontrol.com), added some of the AEC startups he knew.  After Alex and Andy [posted](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alex-huckstepp_the-software-for-hardware-market-is-heating-activity-7175857962136076288-AaKB?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) some slides with some of the initial names, we learned that everybody likes being part of slides with lots of names.  I tend not to be part of clubs that would have me as a member, but with feedback form LinkedIn our list of about 50 companies doubled.  It an attempt to prevent Alex from converting to paid on [LogoIntern](https://logointern.com/), I started trying to remember why one should never mess with [d3.js](https://d3js.org/).  

Data science professionals might tell you that interactive data bubbles, or even the idea of using area to represent a linear size, is "chartjunk", but they are too distracted keeping up with AI.  So enjoy a little play with our industry at [the da Vinci of data's](https://www.edwardtufte.com/) expense while you contemplate the quality of this data.  At the moment of writing, most of the 200+ entries are incomplete.  I'm sure there are tons of omissions or problems.  Feel free to [post a correction]().

## Methodology

While this chart is not data science, it is data driven.  Here's the basic idea behind the process:

Each company or technology receives a vector of *industries*, including:  `MCAD`, `CAE`, `CFD`, `CAM/MES`, `EDA`, `AEC`, and `IM/PM`, and *qualities*, including  `AI/ML`, `Generative`,`PDM/PLM`, `VnV_SCM`, `Hardware`, and `Ecosystem_Community`. Also vendors of *components* of `B_rep`, `Implicit`, and `Physics` kernels are scored.  All of these tags get a:
* `1` if they are building that product or entering that space.
* `2` if they are established in that space.
* `Name` if they are recognizable or referenceable brands, which count as `2` each.

In addition, there's a list of `components`, critical technologies like Parasolid, CUDA, or Nastran on which a product might depend as well as `partnerships` that are valuable but easier to change, including interop toolkits. 

From this data we generate the following display data dimensions:
* Each industry is assigned a hue, and each vendor's starting comes from a weighted average of its industry score fitness vector.  If there's a natural order to our industries, in includes a horseshoe theory where nanoscale IC fabrication meets the industrial manufacturing required to achieve it.  
* The size of each circle represents the funding stage of the company plus its combined weighed score.
* All of the qualities and components are assigned two scores for `moat` and `dank`, which get dotted with the fitness vectors.  
	* The moat score is how hard they would be to reproduce, shown as border width.
	* The dankness refers to the tech makes and darkens the circle.  The OG name for this project was the "dank tech landscape", but it didn't Google well.  Hardware has negative dankness.  
* And then there's metadata for founding data, the headquarter's location, and a URL.  

Perhaps I'll add a proper legend at some point.

## What's next?

I have no idea how enduring this project will be.  Will probably add a legend for the info above and some more controls for controlling forces.  Michael from [Intact.Solutions](https://intact-solutions.com/) requested the `Disrupt` button.  

Would appreciate your feedback and include any company that produces some sort of engineering software.  For now, please enjoy, and happy April 1!
