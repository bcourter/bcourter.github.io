Thanks [Aditya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adityaraghupathy/) for hosting on your ongoing series Breaking the Bottleneck.  

### [Geometry as Code: Blake Courter’s Blueprint for Implicit CAD](https://breakingthebottleneck.substack.com/p/friday-5-blake-courter-co-founder)

“With implicits, construction is transparent to the user; the kernel’s job is to render and convert back to B-reps, so the modeling tech can live in user space and geometry becomes open-source code.”
