Thanks to a prompt from [Synera](https://www.synera.io/), for the [Future of Engienering Summit](https://www.future-of-engineering-summit.com/) I've assembled a historical perspective on both the technology and user experience behind generative design to frame a conversation.  

Spoiler: it ends with category theory.

Will update with more info after the event.
